Processed data format

Separate raw data entries into bar objects according to bar_by (also sort the bar by bar_by).
Entries in bar are grouped by block_by to blocks.

data_for_drawing = {
	'bars'		: [bar_object, ... ],
	'fields'	: [field name, ...],                    // field name same as the above
	'info'		: [info object],               			// info object same as the above
	'bar_by'	: bar_by,                       
	'block_by'	: block_by,
 'bar_by_domain': []
}

bar_object = {
	'blocks'	: [ block_object, ...],
	'count'		: no. of entries,
	'levels'	: no. of blocks,
	'time_by'	: bar_by value,
	'time'		: timestamp in hours, this should match the label when converted to string
